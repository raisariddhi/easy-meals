## Design Process

1. **User Research:** The design process commenced with user research, incorporating feedback and insights gained from the low-fidelity prototypes. This research was vital in understanding user behaviors, pain points, and expectations related to meal planning, grocery shopping, and recipe selection.

2. **Wireframing:** Wireframes were created to establish the basic layout and functionality of the app's screens. This step allowed for early visualization and iteration of the app's structure, ensuring alignment with user needs.

3. **Figma Prototyping:** Figma, a collaborative design tool, was utilized to create the high-fidelity prototype. The platform facilitated the development of interactive and visually rich screens, enabling users to navigate through the app as if it were a fully functional product.

4. **User Testing:** To validate the design and functionality, user testing sessions were conducted with individuals representing the target audience. Their feedback played a pivotal role in refining the prototype, optimizing usability, and identifying areas for improvement.

5. **Iterative Design:** The design process followed an iterative approach, with continuous refinement based on user feedback and design team evaluations. This approach ensured that the final prototype met user expectations and addressed their pain points effectively.
