# Easy Meals - Meal Prep Mobile Interface Prototype

This repository contains the files and documentation for the Meal Prep mobile interface prototype. This project aims to create a user-friendly mobile app to assist college students in planning meals, finding recipes, and locating nearby grocery stores for convenient ingredient shopping.

## User Research

### Target Audience
The target audience for this prototype consists of college students living in on-campus apartments who frequently cook their own meals to save time and money.

### Research Methodology
To gather insights and requirements from the target audience, I conducted a user survey using a Google Form. The survey was distributed to college students who cook their own meals regularly. From the survey responses, I selected two participants who best represented the target audience's needs and preferences.

## Cultural Probe

### Probe Design
The cultural probe used for this study was a Google Form titled "Cultural Probe - Meal Prep." It aimed to collect data about participants' meal planning habits, grocery shopping frequency, recipe search behavior, and their opinions on potential features for a meal prep mobile app. The form consisted of the following questions:

- Participant's name
- Current meal situation (options included not knowing what to cook, needing a recipe, or knowing exactly what to cook)
- Frequency of cooking meals per week
- Frequency of grocery shopping
- Number of meals cooked at once
- Frequency of searching for meal ideas online
- Ratings for the usefulness of two potential app features:
  - Showing recipes based on available ingredients
  - Finding nearby grocery stores for specific ingredients

### Data Collection
Participants were asked to fill out the form daily for a week, providing insights into their meal planning and cooking routines.

## Prototype Development

### App Features
Based on the data collected from the cultural probe, the Meal Prep mobile app prototype will include the following features:

1. **Recipe Recommendation**: The app will suggest recipes based on the ingredients users have in their kitchen. Users can input available ingredients, and the app will provide recipe suggestions.

2. **Grocery Store Locator**: Users can search for specific ingredients, and the app will display nearby grocery stores where they can purchase those ingredients.

### Design and User Interface
The app's design will prioritize user-friendliness and simplicity. It will have an intuitive interface for easy navigation.
